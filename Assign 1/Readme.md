1.
Read an image from the working directory. Find the dimension of the image using appropriate built-in function. Then, your program should compute the mirror image of the input image

2.
You are given a grayscale image of size . Your task is to find different paths between two given points. Your program should take image , points and , and set as inputs and print the locations of all 4-paths, 8-paths and m-paths between these points.

3.
 You are given a binary image . Write a program that can perform the following tasks:
a) Check that if there exists an 8-path between two given input points in the foreground. Assume that the foreground is represented with in the binary image.
b) Convert that one-pixel-thick 8-path to a 4-path.

4.
Read a binary image from the working directory. Write a program to find the number of connected components present in the binary image. Use 8-connected as a connectivity criterion.
